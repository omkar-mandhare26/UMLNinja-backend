I have developed a SaaS which generates UML diagrams using AI. just like you
User can signup using email and password, signup is completed by verifying the the OTP sent on the email
then User can login using email password
A random userId is assigned to the user and by default Free plan is allotted which has 5 credits
There are 3 plans - Free, Pro, Professional
Every diagram takes 1 credit 
Diagram generation is done by using plantUML platform and using their source code to convert .puml to .png or .svg
Here is the complete workflow of the product
First user selects Type of diagram and give user prompt just like how I am giving it to you. Then user clicks generate button which sends request to backend. 
Backend first checks if the user has the credits or not then backend takes systemPrompt for the requested diagram and send systemPrompt and userPrompt to claude API which gives plantUML code and backend writes the code in .puml file and then converts it to .png using source code of plantUML(.jar file)
User can purchase credits by purchasing plans. there is no payment gateway but user can do payment to bank and then fill form of completion of verification of payment.
Whenever diagram is generated and plan is purchased their logs is stored in creditHistory collection in the database
Here is the details information about some entities and my database (mongoDB):
1. user (Important entity and also stored in db):
    attributes: userId, email, password, plan
    operations: signup, login, view-profile
    
2. plan (Important entity): 
    attributes: name, credits, price getMyPlan
    operations: purchasePlan
    
3. credits (Important entity and also stored in db):
    attributes: userId, totalCredits, updatedAt
    operations: checkCredits
    
4. diagram (Important entity):
    attributes: name, type, code
    
5. creditHistory (Important entity and also stored in db):
    attributes: userId, creditUsed, action, timestamp
    operations: saveLogs

6. contact (Stored in db - collection for user to contact us page):
    attributes: name, email, subject, message

7. conversation (Important entity and also stored in db):
    attributes: user, query, diagramName, plantUMLCode, type, createdAt
    operations: generateDiagram, delete-diagram, retrive-diagram, get-all-diagrams

8. otp (stored in db - collection for verifying otp):
    attributes: email, otp, createdAt
    operations: sendOTP, verifyOTP
